## Introduction

AWS DeepRacer is a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to help developers get started with reinforcement learning. These test codes provide advanced reward functions to optimize the training process of DeepRacer models. By incorporating various parameters such as distance from center, track width, speed, steering angle, and progress, these reward functions aim to improve the racing performance of DeepRacer models.

## Installation

To use these advanced reward functions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/race-test-codes.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd race-test-codes
```

3. Set up your AWS DeepRacer environment and training pipeline according to AWS documentation.

4. Replace the reward function in your training script with one of the provided reward functions from this repository.

5. Start training your DeepRacer model with the updated reward function!

## Usage

To use these reward functions effectively, consider the following tips:

- Experiment with different reward functions to find the one that best suits your training objectives.
- Fine-tune reward parameters such as track width, distance from center, speed thresholds, and steering angle thresholds to optimize performance.
- Monitor training progress and adjust reward functions accordingly to achieve desired racing behavior.
- Share your experiences and contribute new reward functions to this repository to help the DeepRacer community grow!
